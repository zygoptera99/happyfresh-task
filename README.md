To tell the truth, im not a programmer and never have a job as programmer before. I only have experience create program in arduino project for my Final Project in college. But i try to create this BMI program using C++ language which i have a little knowledge on this and do browsing to learn it. 

But im very sorry if my output is not as you expected.

Here is how to run the program and what application that i used to write the code:

1. To run the program, simply click "BMI.exe", the program will run in cmd.
2. I'm using C program language for this BMI program and using application "DEV-C++" to compile the code.
3. I also attach the code with name "BMI.cpp" you can open it using DEV-C++ aplication or using notepad.

To answer "what to implementing to secure the application and/or server" here is my recommendation:

- Nex-Gen Firewall,
Many company usually will invest in firewall, WAF, sandbox, spam/email protection, antivirus for each product. But as i know there is a new technology called Next-Gen firewall which have all of those feature in one appliance. So my recommendation is using next-gen firewall that have all of the feature in one appliance is more cheap and simple to maintenance.

- Next-Gen Antivirus,
Implement Next-Gen antivirus - altough in the next gent firewall they already have antivirus, but as far i know. Anti virus in firewall still using old technology aka signature based to detect the virus or malware. This why company need to invest Next-Gen antivirus. Next-Gen antivirus detect malware and virus not only using hash signature but also using Machine Learning AI, behavioral engine etc. Because of this, next-gen antivirus can catch unkown malware or virus that not detected yet in antivirus that used signature-based. Also company dont need to buy or allocate new server for next-gen antivirus because as far as i know, next-gen antivirus using cloud server.

- Keep your system up-to-date,
Keep all your security patch, OS version and application is up-to-date to prevent any vulnerability in old version. Implement patch management system will good for easy maintenance and monitor the vulnerability in the server, so admin dont have to look server one by one to check what vulnerability the server have. And with patch management system, admin also can push update from the management system without have to do it in the server one by one.

- Close unused port and services,
This method is the good ways to prevent any unauthorized access to your system using port or services that company not use.

- Vulnerability scan,
Schedule vulnerability scan at least once every three months to check and detect for vulnerabilty in the server so admin can mitigate the vulnerabily before someone exploit it.

I hope my recommendation can help you to secure your system, im sorry for the program i create if not according to your expectations. One again i'm not experience in programming job but i have experience as network engineer/admin and security analyst as you can see in my CV.


Thank you for the opportunity that has been given me.
